Choose which for your next open source project?

GitHub.

GitHub is slowly killing all the other services

### GitHub
- No ads
- Idea of Forking (this why you want open source right?)
- You can have binaries release too, why not.
- Paid account for hosting finite amount private.

### SourceForge
- Give you tons of distractive and unethical ads.
- No Forking
- Community is large but not interacting and contributing to your projects. They mostly just binary-downloader.

### Google Code
- awesome for geek

### BitBucket
- Much like GitHub, but give unlimited free private repo.
- You would likely want to have both GitHub and BitBucket, one for public one for private, both are free.
