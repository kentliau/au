Most of the time, we are developing a platform instaed of an apps

I am not talking Twitter, Google, Facebook, Dropbox or any other huge and popular website

Even apps like Sublime Text, Alfred, Coda, Sketch, Pixelmator, PS, AE that could just work offline, it is a platform.

Why

It allows you to build extension on top of it, and even make money out of it.

They all provide or expose a set of public APIs that allow developer to build extension for the apps. They usually will be in scripting language.

And who knows, the main apps it self was built with the same set of API that expose to you.
