### MVC
You might probably have heard of this acronym from Rails, .NET Framework or the most popular Cocoa Framework (Mac OS X/iOS).

>Model–view–controller (MVC) is a software architectural pattern for implementing user interfaces. It divides a given software application into three interconnected parts, so as to separate internal representations of information from the ways that information is presented to or accepted from the user. The central component, the model, consists of application data, business rules, logic and functions. A view can be any output representation of information, such as a chart or a diagram. Multiple views of the same information are possible, such as a bar chart for management and a tabular view for accountants. The third part, the controller, accepts input and converts it to commands for the model or view.

You need to be organize. In programming we have many ways of organizing our source code, one of them is MVC architecture.
