We have chosen Laravel.

In this series, we will be build a complete web application using Laravel framework, it is a very new framework but with all the goodies adopted from Ruby on Rails, .NET MVC, Symphony and many more solid third party dependencies.

Everyone can be a programmer, as long as you can write a line of code and execute it, with error or without, you are qualified to be a programmer. To qualify to be a good programmer, you have to write high quality code. If you have no experience in coding within a full framework, you are good. Learning Laravel will guide you to more advance topic in programming. To name a few, DRY, TDD, SOLID, DI, IoC, Abstraction, Contract, MVC, Programming paradigm/Coding Style, Programming architecture.
